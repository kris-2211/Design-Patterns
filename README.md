# Adapter (Wrapper)

# Chain of Responsibility

- **Intent:** Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request and passing it along a chain.

  - For remote objects, expensive objects requiring on-demand creation, or controlled access.

# Singleton

- **Intent:** Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
- **Motivation:** For classes where exactly one instance should exist (e.g., a printer spooler, configuration manager) and needs to be globally accessible.
- **Participants:**
  - **Singleton:** Defines an `Instance` operation that allows clients to access its unique instance and may be responsible for creating the instance.

  - **Visitor:** Declares a `Visit` operation for each ConcreteElement.
  - **ConcreteVisitor:** Implements each `Visit` operation.
  - **Element:** Defines an `Accept` operation.
  - **ConcreteElement:** Implements `Accept` by calling the visitor's corresponding `Visit`.
